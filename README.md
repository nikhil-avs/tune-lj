# tune-lj
FORTRAN codes to tune Lennard-Jones parameters 

This code was used to refine the classical force field for [DEME][TFSI] ionic liquid system. The details of the procedure and the final results were published in "Avula, N. V. S.; Karmakar, A.; Kumar, R.; Balasubramanian, S. Efficient Parametrization of Force Field for the Quantitative Prediction of the Physical Properties of Ionic Liquid Electrolytes. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 4274â€“4290".
